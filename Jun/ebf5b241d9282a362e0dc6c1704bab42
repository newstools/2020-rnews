 Hankey - The Kouga Local Municipality on Monday reminded residents and businesses in Hankey and Patensie that water rationing has resumed. "Water to the towns will be turned off from 09:00 to 15:00 daily from Monday, 1 June," the municipality said. Both towns rely on the Kouga Dam for water. Despite the good rains of last week, the dam level has decreased and stood at 8,73% on Monday morning. "While water rationing has not yet been introduced to other Kouga towns supplied by the Churchill, Impofu and Loerie Dams, the levels of these dams are also low. All residents are, therefore, urged to use water extremely sparingly," the municipality said. "Water restrictions remain in place across Kouga. Please note that hose pipes and irrigation systems may not be connected to the municipal water supply."
