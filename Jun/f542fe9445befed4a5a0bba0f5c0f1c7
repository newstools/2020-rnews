 Port Elizabeth - Drug peddlers will use any means in making sure that their products reach their intended destination, this is what Port Elizabeth police discovered on Wednesday. "Alert members attached to Port Elizabeth Port of Entry seized drugs worth more than R80 000-00 while conducting their day to day operations at one of the courier companies at the airport," said police spokesperson, Colonel Sibongile Soci. "It is alleged that two members were profiling and searching parcels at the courier company when they came across a suspicious parcel. "Custom officials were immediately called to conduct a drug test and it was confirmed that the parcel contained drugs. "A total of 30 heroin tablets, 121g of dagga and 13 dagga seeds were confiscated." No arrests were made and the investigation continues. Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga, commended the alertness of the members. “We have experienced members at all our ports of entry into the Province. These members are thorough and will ensure that nothing illegal passes through these points,” she said. "Ridding of our communities of drugs remains our priority as these drugs also become generators of crime and have far reaching consequences when introduced to our youth."
