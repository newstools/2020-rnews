 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Employee Wellness Centre has been closed till further notice, the municipality said on Sunday. "This comes after confirmation that one of the nurses at the Employee Wellness Centre has tested positive for COVID-19," it described. "The Employee Wellness Centre is currently undergoing de-contamination and deep cleansing as part of health protocols that need to be followed. "Those who have been in direct contact with the nurse are advised to inform their immediate supervisors, get tested and stay in isolation for the next 14 days. "The rest of the staff (secondary contacts) that have visited the centre are advised to monitor themselves closely for symptoms and seek medical help should they suspect that they could have the virus." It added that all employees who were scheduled to attend the wellness centre for screening prior to commencement of duty, are advised to not visit the facility, up until a clear directive has been confirmed by the Municipality.
