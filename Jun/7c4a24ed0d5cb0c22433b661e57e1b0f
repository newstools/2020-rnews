 King Williams Town - An intelligence-driven operation conducted in King William’s Town averted the planned business robbery and led to the arrest of one suspect and the recovery of firearms on Monday. "The operation by Provincial Head Office Crime Intelligence, King William’s Town Flying Squad and King William's Town Crime Intelligence was a response to information about a planned business robbery by the suspects," said olice spokesperson, Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana. "The suspects were then followed to the identified targeted business and were disrupted. "They then allegedly dropped the suspect with firearms in Cambridge Street where police identified and searched him. "The male suspect (30), was found in possession of three pistols with 14 live rounds." Brig Kinana said that the possibility that the firearms could be linked to other reported similar cases cannot be ruled out and they will be sent for ballistic testing. The suspect is expected to appear in the King William's Town Magistrate's Court on Thursday on charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga applauded the members. "The alertness and prompt proactive response was key in the arrest. The integration of resources in operations will go a long way in ensuring that suspects are stopped in their tracks and arrests are effected”, she said.
