 Port Elizabeth - Work is due to start on a new multipurpose sports facility at the Heatherbank Primary School, which serves the Gqebera community in Port Elizabeth. Part funding of R70 000 has been provided by the proceeds of the 2019 Algoa FM Big Walk for Cancer, which was hosted in association with the Eastern Cape Department of Health and the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture. Once completed the school will have a multi-purpose playing field suitable for sports such as soccer, basketball and netball. “Keeping fit and learning ball skills is as important as a good academic education. Thanks to these new sports facilities we will be able to make sure that our children get the best of both”, says Ellen Lovemore, Principal of Heatherbank Primary School. A record number of more than 13 thousand participants at the 2019 Algoa FM Big Walk for Cancer raised a total of R450 000, with the bulk of the funding going towards purchasing a patient transporter for CANSA Eastern Cape. Plans for the 2020 Algoa FM Big Walk for Cancer are well advanced. “I’m very excited about the proposed Covid-safe format for this event. We will be making an announcement shortly,” says Algoa FM marketing manager Lesley Geyer.
