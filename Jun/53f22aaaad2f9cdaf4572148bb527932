 East London - The Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality’s Fire Department on Thursday said it had dealt with 36 fires in a single day. “We have been dealing with a lot of fires more particularly today across the Municipality. We have had 36 fires reported today with our vehicles and officers all over the City putting them out," BCM Spokesperson, Samkelo Ngwenya, said. “With the dry winter season and cold strong winds, we expect these type of incidents to occur more than normal. We ask people to contact us as soon as they see any veld fires so that we can combat the fire before serious damages occur.” “We also want to warn people not to start fires or throw burning things on dry vegetation."
