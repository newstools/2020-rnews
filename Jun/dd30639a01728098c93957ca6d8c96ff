 Uitenhage - Two alert police officers rescued a hijacked victim and also managed to arrest one of the two suspected hijackers in Despatch on Thursday. "On Thursday, at around 7pm, a 57-year-old man alleged that he was busy conversing with someone in his white Volkswagen Polo that was parked on the roadside near Church Street in Despatch," said police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli. "He further said that two men approached the vehicle on the driver’s side, one who was armed with a firearm forced him at gunpoint to move to the backseat. "One of the suspects drove the vehicle towards Botha Street." Sgt Nkohli said that at the corner of Botha and Church streets, a police vehicle that was patrolling spotted the vehicle driving reckless and switched on a siren and blue lights in an attempt to stop it. "The two suspects jumped out of the vehicle and started running in different directions. Police gave chase and managed to arrest one of the two men." Sgt Nkohli said that the second man managed to flee, but his arrest is imminent. The 26-year-old man is due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of hijacking.
