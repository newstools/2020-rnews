 Uitenhage - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality appealed to residents of Uitenhage affected by the water outages in the area for their patience. "Technicians and workers are on site, working around the clock to restore the water supply," the Metro said. "The interruption in supply was caused by the burn-out on Sunday of the pump supplying water to reservoirs supplying the higher lying parts of Rosedale, Kabah and Mountain View. "The pump cannot be repaired and needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, a replacement is not locally available and the Municipality it trying to source one elsewhere. This may well cause a delay into next week." It added that the City has made water tankers available in the affected areas. "Affected residents are encouraged to contact Ward 49 Councillor Franay Van De Linde on 082 303 7358 should they require more information concerning the location of the water tankers." The Metro said that it has also been experiencing problems with the electricity supply to the pump station that supplies water to the reservoir that supplies Scheepershoogte, Valleisig, Winterhoek Park and the higher lying parts of Van Riebeeckhoogte, Fairbridge Heights, Strelitzia Park and Vanes Estate. "The City would like to alert residents that the pump is currently running, but has been the reason for these areas to be without water this week."
