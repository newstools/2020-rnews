 Makhanda - Thursday marked the start of the first-ever Virtual National Arts Festival, which will run from 25 June – 5 July 2020. The festival which is normally held in Makanda, has reinvented itself to be held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdown which prohibits large gatherings. The Executive Mayor of Sarah Baartman District Municipality, Cllr. Khunjuzwa Eunice Kekana said; “During this time of lockdown people are really feeling that they are missing out on things they once enjoyed but the Virtual National Arts Festival offers them the opportunity to experience art and music from the comfort and safety of their own homes. "It makes me think of a quote from our former President, Nelson Mandela, who said ‘Art, especially entertainment and music, is understood by everybody, and it lifts the spirits and the morale of those who hear it’”. Community members are encouraged to support this historic moment in the history of the National Arts Festival. Information on the daily line-up as well as ticket sales is available on the National Arts Festival’s website: https://nationalartsfestival.co.za.
