 East London - The Premier of the Eastern Cape Province, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane, welcomed the economic and social measures responding to the COVID19 pandemic that were announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a correct solution to cushion vulnerable South Africans, working people and the economy from the current wave of economic hardship. "Premier Mabuyane commits the Eastern Cape provincial government to work with the President and Ministers of national government departments to ensure a successful implementation of the plan announced by the President," said the Premier's spokesperson, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha. "Premier Mabuyane said the decision to use food vouchers instead of distributing food parcels to families that need food support was a dignified and important decision that helps to address some of the problematic challenges reported in the province. "Given the socio-economic challenges of the Eastern Cape Province, Premier Mabuyane said these social and economic measures announced by the President will make a meaningful difference to the people hard hit by the impact of the coronavirus." Sicwetsha said that Premier Mabuyane said the work of the provincial economic commission to create development oriented economic options to stabilise the provincial economy while pursuing growth targets, will benefit from the measures announced by President Ramaphosa. "At the direction of the National Treasury, the Eastern Cape Provincial Government is reviewing and repurposing its budget to meet the current challenges."
