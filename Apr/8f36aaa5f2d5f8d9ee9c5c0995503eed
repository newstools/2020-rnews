 Port Elizabeth - Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Interim Executive Mayor, Thsonono Buyeye, says the Metro has made significant progress in preparing for any eventuality as a response to Covid-19 pandemic. "In partnership with the Department of Health, we have decided to be proactive and plan ahead in line with National Government Strategy on Covid 19," Buyeye said. "An isolation site is being established in Nelson Mandela Bay in order to temporarily look after affected or infected by Covid 19. "We know that many of our people will have difficulty with self-isolation, due to housing and other social challenges." He added that the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium is an asset of Government with world-class infrastructure perfectly suited to respond to the current pandemic. "We are working with our entity, the Mandela Bay Development Agency to prepare the Stadium with assistance from our Public Health directorate," Buyeye added.
