 Port Elizabeth - On Saturday, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Metro Police members were all out making sure that Lockdown regulations are adhered to without fail. A total of 43 people were arrested for failing to adhere to the Disaster Management Regulation by failing to be confined to their residence during the lock down period. Those arrested were drivers of motor vehicles and pedestrians. Two of the arrested persons were essential service employees who were not on duty at the time. Metro Police will continue to ensure compliance of the Disaster Management Regulations to curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease. "This will be done without fear or favour. We are in a business of saving lives. This means we cannot take any chances.  Losing one life is one too many," said Metro Police Chief Yolanda Faro. Residents are reminded that they are only allowed to leave their residence if they are rendering an essential service, when buying groceries, going to the pharmacy or seeking medical attention. Residents who do leave their homes under these circumstances must wear a mask and continue to practice social distancing – keep 2m away from other people. Do not stand next to people in a queue. Remember to wash your hands on a regular basis for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser with an alcohol base of at least 60%. By confining to our residences we can curb the spread of this virus. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
