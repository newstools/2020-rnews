 Port Elizabeth - The Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service on Wednesday said that with all talk of the COVID-19 pandemic, little heed has been given to the Nelson Mandela Bay's dwindling water resources. "With the average dam levels of the metro sitting at 23.24%, no major rainfall has been recorded so far this year over the western half of the Eastern Cape," said Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer Eastern Cape South African Weather Service. "Although the western half has had on average 35 mm above the norm for the period January to March, the Langkloof has had a mere 15 mm above the norm. "The eastern half has been more fortunate, receiving on average 114 mm above the norm for the same period. "Although the public is encouraged to wash hands regularly, water should be used sparingly."
