 Mthatha - Eastern Cape MEC for Transport, Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe, on Monday applauded the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) for helping in the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). According to her Department, SANTACO officials in the Chris Hani District took it upon themselves to ensure that every taxi leaving the ranks in Komani had 70% capacity and worked within the stipulated operating times. At least 4 taxis were caught attempting to leave the rank with a full load and will face internal action. MEC Tikana-Gxothiwe said; “We are truly humbled and proud of this gesture by SANTACO. This is further evidence that with all its shortfall and shortcomings, the taxi industry truly has a heart. "For them to take such a bold and a humane stand, for them to say life over profit, at a time when their business is taking a bit of a knock, having missed out on the often profitable Easter Season is truly commendable. "We call on other industry in the province and across the country to follow suite.” Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
