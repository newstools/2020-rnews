 Port Elizabeth - The Environmental Health Practioners of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality were out and about sanitising public spaces since the pronoucement of the Lockdown. They have been cleansing taxi terminus, NMBM Customer Care Centres and the temporary shelters where the homeless are being kept during the Lockdown. They also educate consumers in long queues at shopping centres about the importance of proper hygiene, social distancing when out in public spaces and most importantly, to stay at home. The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality would like to appeal to residents to: - Be responsible citizens and co-operate with the police, defence force and other officials. - Avoid contact with others wherever possible and make your trip as short as possible whenever you go out to get food, essential goods or while seeking medical attention. For any COVID-19 related enquiries please call the NMBM Service Delivery Call Centre on 0800 20 50 50 daily during 7am-4pm.
