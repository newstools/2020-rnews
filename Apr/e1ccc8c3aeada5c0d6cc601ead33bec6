 Port Elizabeth - Residents of Nelson Mandela Bay have welcomed the COVID-19 screening and testing programme conducted by the Department of Health. The programme started this week in different areas across the City. The Department of Health conducted door to door mobile screening and testing in KwaDwesi, Zwide, KwaLanga and Despatch. The following areas have been opened for screening and testing: Walmer Wellness Centre, PE Central Clinic and Raymond Mhlaba Sport Centre.  A mobile clinic will be roaming around in different areas across Metro.   Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Acting Executive Mayor Thsonono Buyeye has commended the Department of Health for the start of the screening and testing. "This effort takes the work that has been done to another level. In as much as we worked to make sure that people stay at home, wash their hands and adhere to all lockdown regulations, it is important to know the magnitude of what we are dealing with. This will help us to be pro-active and put systems in place," said Acting Executive Mayor. The Acting Executive Mayor called on all the residents, more especially from the focus areas like Dwesi, Veeplaas, Zwide, Soweto on Sea and Despatch to go for screening. "Early detection is better because if tested positive it decreases your chances of you infecting your family and other people close to you," added Acting Executive Mayor Buyeye. If the public needs any information about screening and testing, please contact Health Promotions Manager, Ms Fikile Sohuma on 082 097 2788.
