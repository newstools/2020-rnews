 East London - Eastern Cape Transport MEC, Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe, over the weekend welcomed the arrest of a taxi driver over fake permits. According to her Department, the suspect was arrested in Cape Town on charges of fraud, which enabled dozens of people to cross from the WC to the EC and vice versa, contravening the National Lockdown regulations. The accused made the fake funeral permits, using one death certificate and claiming that all the travellers are attending the same funeral. MEC Tikana-Gxothiwe believes the arrest will go a long way in the fight against the ever increasing number of COVID-19 infections in the province. “The movement of people from province to province, especially from the Western Cape has been one of the province’s biggest headache as it battles with an ever rising number of COVID-19 cases. We salute our detectives for the great work they have done in arresting the suspect and more importantly, in the national and global fight against the transmission of COVID-19,” said Tikana-Gxothiwe. A further probe into the possibility of government officials’ involvement this scam is also at an advanced stage, as these fraudulent permits had an official stamp.
