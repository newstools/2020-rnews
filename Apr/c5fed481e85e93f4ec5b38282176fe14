 Mthatha - The Eastern Cape Provincial Government, led by Premier Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane and Transport MEC, Wexiwe Tikana-Gxothiwe, undertook the disinfection intervention at taxi ranks in Mthatha on Wednesday morning. "The purpose of this exercise was to further emphasise the need of maintaining hygiene protocols when in public areas, as one of the ways to combat the Coronavirus," said the Premier's Office. "Premier Mabuyane emphasised that though people need to shop for essentials, it remains very crucial to stay at home and observe lockdown regulations." The Premier later visited the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital and Mthatha Regional Hospital, to inspect the readiness of the two facilities, to receive and treat COVID-19 patients. "The second testing site will be based in Mthatha, where 7000 specimens can be tested daily. This is an addition of the similar facility in Port Elizabeth, which puts the Province in a favourable position to handle the COVID-19 pandemic in the Province."
