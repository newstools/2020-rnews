 Port Elizabeth - 'Eastern Cape' was trending on social media on Saturday after the province recorded its first case of the Coronavirus (Covid-19). The province had largely been spared from the pandemic since the first case of Coronavirus was reported in South Africa. On Friday, the Executive Council of the Eastern Cape Provincial Government took a decision to approve a Provincial Integrated Containment plan for COVID19. The Eastern Cape had also announced its preparedness to deal with Coronavirus cases. According to the Department of Health, the Eastern Cape's first Covid-19 case is a 28-year-old woman, who recently travelled to Germany. The East London woman is reportedly now in self-isolation and being treated at the identified Covid-19 treatment facilities. It was not immediately clear about the status of those she might have been in contact with since her return from Germany. As of Saturday 21 March 2020, South Africa now has 240 confirmed cases of COVID-19. This means there has been an increase of 38 from Friday’s announcement of 202 cases.
