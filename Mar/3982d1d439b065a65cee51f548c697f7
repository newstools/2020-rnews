 Bhisho - The Premier of the Eastern Cape Province, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane welcomes the decision to postpone IronMan South Africa by the organizers as a precaution against the spread of the Coronavirus. Mabuyane says given the fact that the IronMan SA event is an international sporting event attracting participants from all over the world, including from countries where there are high numbers of people who tested positive for the coronavirus, high numbers of people killed by this COVID19 virus, with many others being exposed to people with the coronavirus, this decision is a responsible decision that shows the organizers put the safety of South Africans and of the participants as the top priority. Due to the possibility of spread of coronavirus during sporting events with high numbers of both fans and participants, Premier Mabuyane encourages organizers of other big sporting events to consider postponing these events as a precaution. Premier Mabuyane welcomes the measures being implemented by Transnet’s Ports in East London and Port Elizabeth to ensure that all foreign vessels entering our ports are processed by following the strict measures put in place by the Ports, that are aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus in the country.
