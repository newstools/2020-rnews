 Port Elizabeth - The Democratic Alliance in the Nelson Mandela Bay says it has opened a case of reckless and negligent driving against the driver of a white Polo, who was caught on video driving dangerously along Beach Road, in the early hours of Monday morning. "Yesterday afternoon I, together with DA Ward 2 Councillor, Renaldo Gouws, opened a case at the Humewood Police Station," said John Best Cllr - DA NMB Spokesperson for Safety and Security. "The viral video, which has been circulating on social media since yesterday, shows the driver breaking numerous laws of the road, wheel spinning, driving up the wrong side of the road and even losing control of the vehicle at one point. "It has subsequently come to our attention that the vehicle in question was hired, and this information has also been handed over to the police.  The rental company has agreed to give their full cooperation to the police, and we are expecting an arrest soon."  Best said that not only did the driver place his own life at risk while performing these foolish 'stunts', he also placed the lives of innocent bystanders at risk as well. "The Democratic Alliance is committed to ensure that the rule of law is upheld. The rules of the road are put in place to prevent accidents and protect lives. People who break them must be held to account and face the consequences of their actions." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
