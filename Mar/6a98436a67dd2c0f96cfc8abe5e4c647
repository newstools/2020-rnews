 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Metro Police fired the first salvo to show that the transgression of regulations, imposed to curb the transmission of the novel coronavirus, will be enforced by fining a Central nightclub R 2500 for selling alcohol after 6pm. Metro Police Chief Yolande Faro said the offense was penalised as part of law enforcement patrols focused on law enforcement on Friday night in Central. The non-compliance fine is in accordance with regulation 8 as published in Government Gazette 43107 that limits the sale, dispensing or transportation of liquor stating: 8  (1). All on-consumption premises selling liquor, including taverns, restaurants and clubs, must be closed with immediate effect, or accommodate no more than 50 persons at any time… (4) All on-consumption premises selling liquor referred to in subregulation (1) must be closed – (i) between 18:00 and 09:00 the next morning on weekdays and Saturdays. Shane Brown, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Director of Disaster Management, said this decisive action is indicative of the stern consequences facing individuals disregarding the regulations published as part of the national disaster proclamation. "We would like to appeal to clergy and funeral directions and families to ensure that no more than 100 people are present at church or funeral services. "We are working closely with the police to ensure that compliance is enforced. No exceptions will be tolerated,” Brown said.
