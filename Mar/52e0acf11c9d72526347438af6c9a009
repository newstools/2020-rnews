 East London - The Buffalo City Metro has expressed its disappointment on the inconvenience caused by tertiary institutions, who disrupt cleaning operational services and vandalise infrastructure during protests. "This has been the case recently when tertiary students marched through the City Centre burning tyres, trashing dustbins and damaging infrastructure," the municipality said. "The Metro urges residents in the affected areas with student population namely: the CBD, Quigney and Southernwood not to take out their refuse as per the Metro’s pick up schedule until further notice. "The City has noted that protesting students are using awaiting collection rubbish during their protest." It added that it has organised its Solid Waste Department to start operating in the early hours of the morning to clean these areas when there are no threats of violence or disturbances. "Our Fire Services are attending to the issues related to fires and our and Law Enforcement engaging with SAPS," the Buffalo City Municipality said. "The City will engage the tertiary institutions and is calling all parties within these institutions to resolve issues without disturbing services and inconveniencing ratepayers."
