He said that after approximately 20 minutes of searching, the divers recovered the body of a 10-year-old male, who was identified as Lithemba Platana. The Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga, warned the public to be careful as the torrents in streams and rivers have become frequent after the recent heavy rains.
