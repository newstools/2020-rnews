 Makhanda - The drought-stricken Makana Local Municipality on Friday said that following the recent rain, it is expected that the Howieson's Poort dam will start to overflow soon. "Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Settlers dam which is still at 5%. On 6 March 2020 the municipality commissioned a fly-over over the catchment area for Settler's dam," the municipality said. "The results indicated that not much rain was received at that time. "The good news, however, is that once Howieson's Poort dam starts overflowing it will feed into Settler's Dam." It added that once Settler's reaches 30% the current water rationing system (two days on - one day off) will stop. "However, the overnight throttling water will still continue. The reason for this, is that the municipality is exercising caution to ensure that we have enough reserves going forward. Water restrictions remain in place," the Makana Municipality advised residents. "We appeal to residents to continue to use water sparingly. This will ensure that we have adequate water to supply the whole community consistently." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
