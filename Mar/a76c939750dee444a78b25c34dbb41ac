 Jeffreys Bay - The Kouga Local Municipality on Monday morning advised residents that the water supply to sections of Wavecrest will be lower than usual this week due to upgrades being done at the Jeffreys Bay Water Treatment Works. "The affected area stretches from AD Keet up to the R102, including the Pride of India area, Mertle, Salie and Maidenhair," the municipality said. "We would like to appeal to residents to use water extra sparingly this week so as to help prevent the reservoir from running dry completely. "Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience."
