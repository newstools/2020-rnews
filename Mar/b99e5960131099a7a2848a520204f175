 Port Elizabeth - The strong winds experienced overnight are expected to continue throughout the day on Thursday according to a forecast from the Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service. "A cold front will be moving south of the country this evening, with a strong high pressure ridging in behind," said Garth Sampson, the SA Weather Service's Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape, on Wednesday. "Due to the intensity of the pressure gradient, we are expecting strong winds along the coast and in the adjacent interior between Cape St. Francis and Port St. John's during evening today and throughout the day tomorrow [Thursday]. He said people should be aware of sudden crosswinds if traveling especially between buildings, fallen trees or power lines and flying debris, especially on the roads along the coast. "Small boats must stay away from the open sea and seek the shelter of a harbour, river estuary or protected bay," Sampson added. "Aircraft parked outside should point into the direction of the wind and be secured to the ground. Listen to the radio or TV for warnings and obey the instructions from disaster management officers."
