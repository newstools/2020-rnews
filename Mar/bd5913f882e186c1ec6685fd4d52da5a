 Port Elizabeth - The Democratic Alliance on Wednesday applauded the South African Police Service for the speedy arrest of a 25-year-old individual after a viral video surfaced of reckless driving along Beach Road in Nelson Mandela Bay. "This follows after I, together with DA Ward 2 Councillor, Renaldo Gouws, opened a case at the Humewood Police Station late on Monday afternoon [Case no CAS 27/3/2020]," said John Best Cllr - DA NMB Spokesperson for Safety and Security. "The viral video, which has been circulating on social media since Monday, shows the driver breaking numerous laws of the road, doing handbrake turns, wheel spinning, driving up the wrong side of the road and even losing control of the vehicle at one point."  Best said that the individual is scheduled to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates court on Wednesday 4 March 2020. "Not only did the driver place his own life at risk while performing these foolish “stunts”, he also placed the lives of innocent bystanders at risk as well," he said. "The Democratic Alliance is committed to ensure that the rule of law is upheld. The rules of the road are put in place to prevent accidents and protect lives. People who break them must be held to account and face the consequences of their actions." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
