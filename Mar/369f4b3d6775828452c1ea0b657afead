 Port Elizabeth - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Nelson Mandela Bay says it welcomes news that action has been taken against officials, implicated in the Milongani Eco-Consulting PwC forensic report. "Media reports indicate that action has finally been taken against officials, implicated in the Milongani Eco-Consulting PwC forensic report into allegations of tender rigging, fraud and collusion in the Public Health directorate. Five senior officials’ employment contracts with the Metro have reportedly been terminated," said Leander Kruger Cllr - DA NMB Public Health Spokesperson. "Former Democratic Alliance (DA) Mayor Athol Trollip called for a probe into projects the company was involved in, as early as March 2017. "The company allegedly submitted invoices, and were paid, for services rendered on the same day that their tender agreement was signed." Kruger said that every cent of public money spent in respect of the identified fraud must be accounted for. "Now that it has been established that there was irregular and/or fraudulent expenditure and the resultant disciplinary action, the next steps must be taken to hold accountable those implicated including financial recoveries in terms of the Public Audit Amendment Act as well as criminal charges." She said that she will write to the Acting City Manager to present the forensic report to Council and to provide details regarding further steps to be taken against those implicated.
