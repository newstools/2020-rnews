 East London - As we head into a new decade, many aspiring entrepreneurs will be looking to start their own successful businesses and potentially contribute to creating much needed jobs and GDP growth in South Africa. Lauren Deva, Sales Head for FNB Business Core Banking, says that since FNB’s integration into the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) in July 2013, FNB has assisted with the registration of 65 241 companies. The CIPC annual report for 2018/19 shows that the volume of company registrations increased by approximately 9000 registrations compared to the 2017-2018 financial year. Deva adds that, while success can never be completely guaranteed, there are key steps that entrepreneurs should consider when planning to start a business.  These include the following Take advantage of opportunities to showcase your business, whether it’s via an advert in your child’s school newsletter or an advert in a local newspaper. Don’t underestimate the power of word-of-mouth advertising either – people can’t support your business if they are unsure of what you do. Social media is a great platform to create a buzz around your product offering so use the tools available to put your business in the spotlight. “In these tough times, we look to the SME sector to revitalise the South African economy, but small business owners are urged to take the correct steps to ensure that they launch competitive, thriving businesses,” Deva concludes.
