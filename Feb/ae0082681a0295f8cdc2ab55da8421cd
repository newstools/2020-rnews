 Makhanda - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape says it is shocked by a Makana Municipal Council decision to appeal the Makhanda High Court judgement ordering it to be dissolved and an administrator appointed until a new council is elected. "During a council sitting today, 30 January 2020, councillors voted 15 to 9 to appeal the judgment. The seven DA councillors, who all voted against appealing the judgement, vociferously spoke out against yet another frivolous waste of public money," said DA Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga. "Council has now written a blank cheque with rate payers' money and this is a slap in the face of the long-suffering people of Makana. "The DA has on numerous occasions called for the council to be dissolved so that fresh elections can be held and the people can vote in a government that is actually capable of bringing change to Makana." Bhanga said that the current failing ANC government has run this once prosperous municipality into the ground, but its 15 councillors seem hell-bent on wasting even more money and further delaying Makana’s return to prosperity. "The council’s decision also follows shortly after the Premier of the Eastern Cape, Oscar Mabuyane, announced that the provincial government will be appealing the high court judgement," he added. "It is clear that the ANC is trying to rob residents of an opportunity to vote for change in fresh elections and put the Makana Local Municipality back on track by electing a DA led government."
