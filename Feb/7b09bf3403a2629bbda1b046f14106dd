 Port Elizabeth - No loadshedding is expected on Monday, Eskom advised South Africans. The power utility said that this is because it expects additional power generating units to return to service later on Monday. While Eskom's Emergency Reserves are at adequate levels, the return of these units will further help it avoid resorting to loadshedding.   #POWERALERT 1Date: 24 February 2020No loadshedding expected today pic.twitter.com/SUsV74hvIX   Eskom reminded South Africans that there is a possibility of increased loadshedding over the next 18 months as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health. It appealed to customers to continue to use electricity sparingly and to assist us in reducing demand: "We appeal to customers to revisit their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments."
