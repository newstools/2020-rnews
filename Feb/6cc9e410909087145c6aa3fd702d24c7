 Port Elizabeth - Prospective clients of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Traffic and Licensing Centres in Uitenhage and Korsten are advised that renewals of driver’s licenses or any services requiring electronic bookings cannot be transacted at this time. Warren Prins, Director of Traffic and Licensing, said challenges experienced by the Driving License Card Account (DLCA), based in Pretoria, are resulting in the Live Enrolment Unit (LEU) machines not operating at this stage. “Unfortunately we do not have a timeframe when these machines, used to renew and issue newly acquired driver’s license and book learner’s licenses amongst others, will be back online. “These machines log on to national software systems to transact. “We would like to advise prospective clients to postpone a trip to our facilities until further notice,” Prins said.
