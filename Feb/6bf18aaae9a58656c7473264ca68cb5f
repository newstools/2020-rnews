 Eskom, which suspended load shedding on Sunday night - after implementing Stage 3 loadshedding on Saturday, says that it does not expect to implement loadshedding on Monday. "Loadshedding not expected today, but the possibility of loadshedding during the week remains," the power utility said.  #POWERALERT 1Date: 17 February 2020Loadshedding not expected today, but possibility of loadshedding during the week remains @SABCNewsOnline @IOL @eNCA @ewnupdates @TimesLIVE @SowetanLIVE pic.twitter.com/oktmKM2Gx0  Eskom reminded South Africans that there is a possibility of increased loadshedding over the next 18 months as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health. It appealed to customers to continue to use electricity sparingly and to assist us in reducing demand: "We appeal to customers to revisit their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments."
