 Port Elizabeth - No loadshedding is expected on Tuesday, but the possibility of loadshedding during the week remains, Eskom said. "The generation system has improved enough that the outlook is positive and there will be no loadshedding today," the power utility said. "However, we remind customers that the system remains vulnerable and that loadshedding can be implemented at short notice if there are any additional changes in the system performance. "Additional generating units have successfully returned to service and emergency reserves are at adequate levels. Eskom will communicate regularly." Eskom said that unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10 853MW as at 06:00 this morning while planned maintenance is at 5 353MW. "Even though there are some improvements, we request customers to continue to reduce demand and to use electricity sparingly during this period," it added. "There is a possibility of increased loadshedding over the next 18 months as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health." It said that South Africans can help to reduce demand: "We appeal to customers to revisit their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments."
