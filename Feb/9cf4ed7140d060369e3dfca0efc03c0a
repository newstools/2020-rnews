It is because of this debt that Eskom had threatened to switch off the municipality. The Dr Beyers Naude Local Municipality is one of many Eastern Cape municipalities that apparently owe Eskom around R1 billion. "Eskom reiterates that implementation of electricity supply interruption to defaulting municipalities is only done as a last resort," it said.
