 Port Elizabeth - The discovery of a seriously electrocuted man with serious burn wounds during an alleged attempted cable theft at the Ditchling electricity substation made for a very unpleasant experience for Nelson Mandela Bay electricity and energy employees. Elton Ambraal and his colleague Peter Cawood were called out to investigate a complaint that areas fed by the Ditchling substation did not have electricity at approximately midnight. “When we entered the substation, my colleague first saw an unknown man and called me to the scene. “His clothes was completely charred from the effect of the 66 000 volt electrical current ripping through his body. The only pieces left of the man’s incinerated clothing was around his waist. One of his legs was completely gone. “Peter called the ambulance, South African Police Services and our municipal security. We tried our best to keep him and gave him water, as he was very thirsty. “It was really not a nice experience to see something like it. I watched videos of electrocution victims before but never came experience it in real life. The ambulance personnel and the Algoa Park Saps took the victim from the scene. We recently had a similar incident,” Ambraal said. The first instance took place a few weeks ago on 21 January at the same electricity substation. Anthony Bosch, now deceased, was electrocuted at 01:46 when he also came into contact with the same 66kV cable. He was hospitalised and subsequently succumbed to his injuries.
