"While stationary at the robots at the corners of CJ Langenhoven and Norvic Drive, they were confronted by six suspects, three on each side of the mini bus. "One was armed with a firearm. One suspect opened the driver’s side door and demanded the money." She said that none of the occupants responded to the demand and a shot was fired hitting Abdul Kieran Haroon (35) in his chest.
