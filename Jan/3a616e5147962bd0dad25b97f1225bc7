 Port Elizabeth - While the Department of Water and Sanitation said there had been a slight improvement in Eastern Cape dam levels, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Thursday said that dams supplying the Metro were still very low - despite the rains in the last few days. The recent sporadic rain in Nelson Mandela Bay might have been a relief for plants and residents with water tanks but it did not have any significant impact on the levels of our main water supply dams, it said. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Member of the Mayoral Committee for Infrastructure, Engineering, Electricity and Energy, Andile Lungisa, said residents must remain vigilant and report water wastage while the municipality, in turn, will continue its efforts to conserve water to the best of its ability. "The updates and predictions that we receive from the South African Weather Services paint a bleak picture. It, therefore, means that we all have to comply with the stringent water restrictions that are currently in place,” MMC Lungisa said.
