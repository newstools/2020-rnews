 Port Elizabeth - Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Director for Infrastructure and Engineering, Dr Walter Shaidi, says the curtailment of consumption levels is crucial since further punitive tariffs were implemented when our dam levels reached 20% in the past. This predicament is currently staring us in the face with average dam levels at 29.4%. "These punitive charges are implemented during water shortage emergencies to ensure that we stretch our resources as far as possible. "It is especially worrisome as we entered a period until approximately May that could be drier than normal as per the predictions by the South African Weather Services,” Shaidi explains. "However, we have been proactive over the years to supplement our water supply with the phased implementation of the Nooitgedacht Water Treatment Works, the improvement of the bulk water transfer infrastructure with the completion of the Motherwell and Standford Road booster pump stations and the drilling of boreholes amongst others. "Our 10 year business plan has been approved with a specific focus on reducing non-revenue water which means the municipality will be able to gain greater value from this treasured resource." The completion of phases 1 and 2 of the Nooitgedacht Water Treatment Works increased the water treatment capacity from 90 Ml per day to 140 Ml with construction of phase 3 of the Nooitgedacht in progress. Expected to be completed by August 2021, the water treatment capacity of the Nooitgedacht Water Treatment Works will be improved to 210 Ml per day. Construction at the Loerie Water Treatment Works is also currently in progress. Part B of the Charges & Tariffs (Applicable during times of water shortage) (Excl.
