 Port Elizabeth - Some welcomed follow-up rain was recorded over the drought-ravaged Eastern Cape overnight, the Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service says. "An additional 10 mm brought the total rainfall for the Fort Beaufort area to 80 mm over the last three days," explained Garth Sampson, SA Weather Service Client Liaison Officer (Eastern Cape Region). "Grahamstown/Makanda had 49 mm and Graaf Reinett had 41 mm. "Although the main stations in the Nelson Mandela Bay's catchment area received between 10 and 46 mm over the last three days, further up the Langkloof Uniondale had 20 mm and Willowmore 28mm." Sampson said that the highest figure on Wednesday night was recorded in Cradock with 21 mm bringing its total for the last three days to 37mm "The Bay only recorded 5 mm on Wednesday night," he added. "The outlook is for isolated thundershowers to the north and eastern regions of the province this afternoon. "Although great for the garden this rain has NOT broken the drought and the public must continue to use water sparingly."
