 Port Elizabeth - Despite what it described as a volatile system, Eskom assured South Africa that no loadshedding expected on Monday. "Eskom continues to manage a volatile power system but there is a low risk of loadshedding today. We begin the week with generation units breakdowns at 13 392 MW as at 07:30 this morning," the power utility said. "Our forecast shows that the system is tighter than last week so we will use our emergency generators to supplement capacity while work to return units that were out of service for maintenance continues. "We have replenished our emergency reserves, viz. diesel and water, over the weekend. This will enable us to deploy open cycle gas turbines and pumped water storage schemes at short notice in case the need arises. "We will give periodic updates on the status of the power system." "We request our customers to work with us by reducing their demand while we work on stabilising the power system," Eskom said.
