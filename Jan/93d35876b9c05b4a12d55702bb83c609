 Port Elizabeth - The Anti-Gang Unit operating in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth are making significant strides in stamping their authority on gang activities in the area. "On Saturday, at about 15:45, AGU members were patrolling in Gelvandale," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "As they drove up Reginald Road they heard shots being fired close by. As they approached a 4-way stop, they spotted a male shooting down Reginald Rd. "They got out and the suspect started firing at them. They returned fire injuring him in his groin." Col Naidu said that a tanfoglia firearm (partial serial number) was seized. "While they were still busy at this scene, they were informed that a 50-year-old woman was fatally wounded in Reynecke Street. Sharon Dageford from Libra Street was struck in her cheek." Col Naidu said it is unclear at this stage, who the suspect was shooting at when he allegedly struck Dageford, who was walking in the street. "He is detained on charges of murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. The firearm will be sent to ballistics for etching and further analysis." The 23-year-old gang affiliate is expected to appear in court soon. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
