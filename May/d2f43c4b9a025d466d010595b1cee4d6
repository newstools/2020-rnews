 East London - Officials from the Buffalo City Metro, the SAPS and Eskom were in disbelief when they found an illegal transformer connected to the Eskom grid. "The transformer had been stolen from the Municipality and was discovered on Friday connected in the informal settlement of Igoda," the municipality said. Igoda is a small informal settlement in the bush en-route to Kidds Beach, in East London, and is estimated to be having about 100 shacks. "Judging from how the transformer was connected, officials concluded that this is definitely a coordinated effort by the community to steal electricity," the Metro said. "Police are investigating the matter." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook. For news on the Western Cape click here.
