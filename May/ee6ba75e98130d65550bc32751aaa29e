 Queenstown - Efforts by Queenstown Detectives to end housebreaking incidents in the town paid off after three sleepless nights when they arrested five suspects and recovered goods including bedding, beds, kitchen utensils and electric appliances to the value of R500 000. "The three-day operation was activated after police recorded an increase in housebreaking incidents at Lessyton Administrative Area within a short time," said police spokesperson, Captain Khaya Tonjeni. "The members received valuable information and immediately acted on it and proceeded to the houses where suspected stolen goods were believed to be kept. "Five suspects aged between 30 and 40 years were arrested and are expected to appear before Queenstown Magistrates’ Court on Thursday." Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga commended the members for the swift move which resulted in the arrest and recovery of goods. "Our efforts must be felt by criminals through arrests and heard by the community through arrests and recoveries like this. She also appealed to the community to reject and report stolen goods," she added. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
