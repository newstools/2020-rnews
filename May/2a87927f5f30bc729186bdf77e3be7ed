 Port Elizabeth - Some nice rain fell over the last 48 hours over most of the Eastern Cape, the Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service said on Wednesday. "The Nelson Mandela Bay received between 57 mm at the Airport and 82 mm at 3rd Avenue Dip," said Garth Sampson, South African Weather Service Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape. "The Langkloof catchment had between 36 mm at Joubertina and 69 mm at Kareedouw. "Snow has been reported on the mountains around Graaf Reinette and Barkley East and along the escarpment up to Maclear. "Reports of snow were also received from Hogsback, the Tsitsikama, Kouga and Swartberg Mountains."  More snow. This time near Graaff Reinet (Lootsberg Pass) this evening (Eastern Cape).

"Port Elizabeth recorded the coldest maximum for the year at 12°C on the same day." Sampson said that conditions will clear later with another system passing along the coastal areas on Friday "Although the falls were most welcome they will do little to alleviate our water crisis so PLEASE continue to use water sparingly."
