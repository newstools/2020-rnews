 East London - The Executive Mayor of Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality on Sunday welcomed the deployment of the Cuban Medical Brigade in an effort to bolster efforts of fighting COVID-19 in Buffalo City Metro. “We are deeply delighted by this act of solidary by the Cuban people and their medical staff which continues to show great levels of human solidarity that is unparalleled across the world. We welcome the Cuban doctors and others health services personnel who are here to assist us to better fight the Corona Virus,” said Executive Mayor Pakati. The Executive Mayor has praised the Provincial Government for seeing the need to ensure this substantial deployment of the Cuban medical brigade to the City. “We want to thank the Provincial Government for deploying some members of this Cuban medical team to our city after it received its allocation from the National Government. "This shows that there is a great appreciation by the Premier and the MEC of Health that our City is one of the hotspots of the virus in the Eastern Cape and containing the virus in Buffalo City will also help minimise its spread in other areas of the province. This is due to the fact that many people from outside the metro commute to the city for a number of economic and social reasons,” he said. “We are looking forward to working with the Cuban Medical Brigade in confronting this global pandemic. This act of solidary continues to prove to us that we need to work together to fight this virus,” he said.
